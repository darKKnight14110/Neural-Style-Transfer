# Neural Style Transfer 
This is a project I completed as a part of Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearningAI. Developed a comprehensive Neural Style Transfer system to create artistic images by blending content and style images. Leveraged transfer learning on a pretrained VGG-19 model, initially trained on the Imagenet dataset, to extract high-level image features effectively. Implemented the Tensorflow Arbitrary Image Stylization model, enabling fast and efficient neural style transfer. This approach significantly improved the system's performance and output quality. The project demonstrates advanced proficiency in deep learning techniques, neural networks, and image processing, showcasing the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world applications in the field of AI and computer vision.
